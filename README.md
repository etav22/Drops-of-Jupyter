# Drops-of-Jupyter
This repo houses several different jupyter notebooks to demonstrate skillset. Mainly centered around modelling, data exploration and new python packages.

## Setup
For this repository, I used a `conda` virtual env to house all my dependencies. Nevertheless, a regular virtualenv can be used and the dependencies can be installed via the `requirements.txt`:
```
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notebooks
Where all the magic happens! All the jupyter notebooks are housed in the `notebooks` directory. As the repo grows, I will most likely add more directories to house different sorts of notebooks.
